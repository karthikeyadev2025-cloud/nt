# Nikki Technologies — nikkitechnologies.com

Multi-segment business platform: **CCTV Installation | Digital Media | Software Solutions** — one backend, one login, full no-code Super Admin control.

## Stack
React 18 + Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind + Supabase (Postgres, Auth, RLS, Edge Functions).

## Architecture
- **segments** table — verticals are dynamic. Add a 4th segment from Super Admin → tickets, leads, staff scoping, website sections all pick it up automatically.
- **app_users** — role + `segments[]` (`{cctv}`, `{software}`, `{all}`) + per-user `permission_overrides` (jsonb). RLS enforces segment scoping at DB level.
- **products** — Software Solutions catalog (MyStore OS, Punchly, Jovio pre-seeded). Add/edit from panel, link-out model.
- **support_tickets** — auto-numbered per segment (NKT-CC-00001 / NKT-DM / NKT-SW), per-segment ticket types, public "Raise a Ticket" form, staff scoped views.
- **marketing_leads** — CRM pipeline (new→contacted→qualified→quoted→won/lost), segment-routed from website form, remarks thread.
- **HR/Payroll** — attendance (GPS check-in/out), leaves, salary advances. One central HR (`segments={all}`) sees everyone grouped by segment.
- **site_content** — every public text editable from panel.

## Roles
`super_admin` (full control + Access Control panel) · `manager` · `hr` · `marketing_executive` · `telecaller` · `support_agent` · `employee`.
Super Admin can override any function permission per user (view_leads, manage_tickets, approve_advances, manage_content, …) without code.

## Setup (new Supabase project)
1. Create project at supabase.com → copy URL + anon key into `.env` (see `.env.example`).
2. Run the single migration: `supabase/migrations/20260709000001_nikki_technologies_init.sql` (SQL Editor → paste → run). Seeds 3 segments, services, ticket types and the 3 products.
3. Deploy edge functions:
   ```
   supabase functions deploy create-user
   supabase functions deploy bootstrap-super-admin
   ```
4. Create the first super admin (one-time; function locks itself after):
   ```
   curl -X POST https://YOUR-PROJECT.supabase.co/functions/v1/bootstrap-super-admin \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR-ANON-KEY" \
     -d '{"email":"you@nikkitechnologies.com","password":"STRONG-PASSWORD","full_name":"Karthikeya"}'
   ```
5. `npm install && npm run dev` — login at `/login`.
6. Deploy: push to GitHub → import in Vercel → add the two env vars → set domain nikkitechnologies.com.

## Routes
- `/` — public site (segments, products, raise ticket, lead form)
- `/login` — unified staff login → Super Admin dashboard or Staff Portal (tabs appear per permissions)

## Onboarding & Documents
- **Super Admin → Documents & Onboarding**: create/edit templates (Offer Letter, Welcome Letter, Roles & Responsibilities, custom) per segment. Placeholders: `{{name}} {{designation}} {{role}} {{segment}} {{joining_date}} {{ctc}} {{employment_type}} {{company}}`.
- **Super Admin → Access Control → Onboard Employee**: 5-step wizard — basic info, role/segment, salary structure (basic/HRA/allowances/deductions/CTC), pick documents to auto-issue, review & create. Account + salary + documents all created together.
- Existing staff can be issued additional documents anytime from Documents & Onboarding → Issue Documents.
- **Employee → My Documents** tab: view/print/download every issued document, see full salary breakdown, and acknowledge documents (timestamped, visible to HR) — full transparency, builds trust.

## Post-launch
- Regenerate strict DB types: `supabase gen types typescript --project-id XXX > src/lib/database.types.ts` and re-add `<Database>` generic in `src/lib/supabase.ts`.
- Replace placeholder contact number/email in Super Admin → Website Content.
- Add real logo/og-image/icons in `public/`.

## E-Signature Flow
- Templates (Super Admin → Documents & Onboarding) have a **"Requires employee signature"** toggle. Default: on for Offer Letter/Welcome Letter, off (acknowledge-only) for Roles & Responsibilities/Policy.
- Employee opens a document in **My Documents** → draws a signature on a canvas pad or types their legal name (rendered in cursive) → confirms. The signature image (or typed name) + timestamp is stored permanently on that document row.
- Documents not requiring a signature get a lighter "I acknowledge I've read this" confirmation instead.
- Every staff row in **Access Control** and **Documents & Onboarding** shows a live badge: `X/Y signed` or `Onboarding complete` — so you can see at a glance who still needs to finish onboarding.
- Print/Save-as-PDF includes the captured signature image and signing timestamp on the printed document.

## Ported from Punchly (smart-timekeeper)
Safe-checked and adapted to Nikki's schema (no tenants — segment-scoped instead):
- **In-app Notifications** — bell icon in both portal headers, unread badge, mark-as-read, auto-fires on: ticket/lead activity via triggers, shift swap requests, bank change approval/rejection, announcements.
- **Announcements** — Super Admin posts to all staff or one segment; pinned + auto-expiry; shows as a feed on the employee home tab and notifies everyone instantly.
- **Shift Swap Requests** — employee requests a swap (optionally with a named colleague), manager/HR approves from the same board; both sides get notified.
- **Bank Details + Change Approval** — employee submits new bank details from **My Profile**; nothing changes until HR approves from **Bank Approvals** — protects payroll from silent/fraudulent edits. Approved changes apply automatically via a DB trigger.
- **Digital ID Card** — auto-generated per employee (segment-branded colors), viewable and printable from **My Profile**. Auto-numbered staff codes (`NKT-EMP-0001…`) assigned on creation.
- **My Stats** — day streak, days present, on-time % over the last 30 days, shown on the employee's attendance tab.
- **Punctuality Leaderboard** — Super Admin Overview, top 10 staff by on-time %, last 30 days.
- **Birthdays & Anniversaries widget** — Super Admin Overview shows anyone with a birthday or work-anniversary today (no cron needed — computed on page load).

Not ported (native-mobile-only, needs Capacitor/device APIs): face-verification selfie matching, native push notifications, PIN quick-login. These only make sense in the Capacitor mobile build; Nikki is web-only for now.

## Dashboard Polish (best practices pass)
Audit found the app had **zero user feedback on failure** — every save/create/delete/approve either succeeded silently or failed silently with no indication. Fixed:
- **Toast system** (`src/lib/toast.tsx`) — success/error/info notifications, auto-dismiss, wired into every mutation across both portals: tickets, leads, HR approvals, onboarding, access control, segments, products, catalog, templates, document issuance, content, announcements, shift swaps, bank approvals.
- **Error Boundary** — a component crash now shows a recovery screen with reload button instead of a blank white page.
- Every Supabase mutation now checks `{ error }` and reports it instead of assuming success.
- Destructive actions (delete product, delete announcement) confirm before executing.

## Careers / Hiring
- **Public "Careers" section** on the homepage — lists open job postings (segment-tagged), each with an "Apply Now" that opens a form: name, phone, email, experience, passport-size photo upload, resume upload (PDF/DOC), plus any custom screening questions the job defines. A "Don't see your role?" link lets people submit a general application too.
- Files upload to a **private** storage bucket (`career-uploads`) — public can upload, only staff with `view_careers`/`manage_careers` can read them (via short-lived signed URLs, not public links).
- **Super Admin/HR → Careers / Hiring** tab: post/edit/close job postings per segment with custom screening questions; review applications in a pipeline (New → Shortlisted → Interviewed → Hired/Rejected), view photo and download resume from the same panel.
- `view_careers` / `manage_careers` are granted to the `hr` role by default and can be granted to anyone else via Access Control → Manage Access, same as every other permission.

## Where to add staff
Super Admin → **Overview** now has a banner shortcut "+ Onboard Employee" at the top, or go directly to **Access Control → + Onboard Employee**. That single wizard creates the account, salary, and documents together.

## NIKKI Intro Animation
Replaced the static loading spinner with a letter-by-letter reveal of "N-I-K-K-I" on every page load before the site/portal appears (`LoadingScreen.tsx`).

## Telecaller Workflow (Excel bulk assign, click-to-call, counts-only dashboard, callback retention, executive handoff approval)
- **Bulk Upload** (Super Admin CRM tab, or Manager's own portal if granted `bulk_assign_leads`): upload an Excel/CSV of leads (Name, Phone, Email, Notes columns), pick a segment, optionally assign the whole batch to one telecaller in one shot.
- **Telecaller experience** is now fundamentally different from Manager/Admin — controlled by a new `full_leads_view` permission (on by default for manager/hr/executive, off for telecaller, overridable per-user in Access Control):
  - **Off** → she sees a **counts-only dashboard** (queue size, calls made today, callbacks pending, converted this month, transfers awaiting approval — no raw data grid) plus her **own Call Queue**: only leads currently assigned to her.
  - Each queue row has a **click-to-call** button (`tel:` link — opens the phone dialer directly).
  - Logging an outcome is mandatory before a lead leaves her queue. **Callback Requested** keeps the lead in her queue (with the callback date shown, sorted to the top). Every other outcome (interested/not interested/no answer/converted) **releases the lead back to the pool** — it disappears from her queue and only a manager/admin can reassign it.
  - She can also **request a handoff to a Field Executive** once an appointment is fixed — this doesn't move the lead directly; it creates a pending request that a **Manager or Super Admin must approve** before the executive actually receives it. Same mechanism across all three segments (CCTV/Digital Media/Software) since it's segment-agnostic on the shared `marketing_leads` table.
- **Manager/Super Admin → CRM → Handoff Approvals**: review and approve/reject pending telecaller→executive requests; both sides get notified automatically.
- All of this is permission-gated (`full_leads_view`, `bulk_assign_leads`, `approve_transfers`), so you decide per person — not hardcoded by role — via Access Control → Manage Access.

## Confirmed / Fixed from cross-check
- **Selfie attendance** — check-in and check-out now open the device camera (works in any browser, desktop or mobile) and capture a photo before submitting. Stored to the private `selfies` bucket, viewable by HR/managers via "Photo" link (signed URL) next to each attendance record. **Important distinction:** this is photographic proof-of-presence, not biometric face-matching verification — that requires ML/device-native APIs and remains out of scope for the web app (see Punchly cross-check note).
- **Offer Letter & Welcome Letter are now segment-specific** (previously generic/company-wide) — CCTV, Digital Media and Software each get their own tailored wording, matching how Roles & Responsibilities already worked.
- **Reporting Time / Shift** is now captured during onboarding and appears on the Offer Letter and Welcome Letter automatically (`{{reporting_time}}` placeholder).
- **Job Description** added as its own document type, with a starter template per segment (Field Technician / Digital Media Executive / Software Developer) — Super Admin can add more per specific role from Documents & Onboarding → New Template.
- Confirmed already working: documents auto-filter to the employee's segment, e-signature capture (draw or type) on every generated document.

## Work From Home + Performance Graphs + Bonus/Incentive Structure
- **Work From Home** — available to every role including telecallers (attendance is a shared self-service feature). Check-in now asks Office / Work From Home / Field Visit first; the choice is stored per record and shown in the 14-day history.
- **Salary structure extended**: Basic, HRA, Allowances, Deductions, **Performance Bonus**, **Incentives**, Annual CTC — all editable by Super Admin (onboarding wizard + Access Control → Manage Access), all visible to the employee in My Documents for full transparency.
- **Performance graphs (recharts), interactive across both portals:**
  - Employee: Hours Worked bar chart (last 14 days, computed from actual check-in/check-out times)
  - Telecaller: Calls Logged bar chart (last 7 days)
  - Super Admin Overview: Company Attendance trend line (14 days), Ticket Status pie chart, Leads Funnel by segment (stacked bar: New → In Progress → Won)
- **Portal home screen polish** — attendance tab now opens with a welcome banner showing designation, segment, staff code, joining date and reporting time at a glance.

## Marketing Executive: Field Visit Workflow (was missing — now built)
Previously Marketing Executives shared the generic CRM board with no field-specific tools. Now they get a dedicated **Field Visits** tab:
- **My Field Leads** — only leads assigned to them (from telecaller handoffs or direct assignment), active ones only
- **Log a Visit**: opens the device camera to take a **client/site photo**, captures **GPS location** and auto-resolves it to a **readable address** (reverse geocoding via OpenStreetMap Nominatim — free, no API key), a **"Open in Google Maps"** link, an outcome selector (Follow-up / Interested-quoting / Closed Won / Closed Lost), and a conversation/visit note — all required before saving
- Closing a lead (Won/Lost) automatically releases it back to the pool, same release pattern as the telecaller queue
- **Visit History** — every past visit for that lead shown with timestamp, note, address and photo link
- **Managers/Super Admin** now also see photo + address inline in the standard Leads Board remark thread — full visibility into what the field team captured, no separate reporting needed
- Fixed a permission bug: Marketing Executives had accidentally been granted the full CRM board (`full_leads_view: true`) instead of a role-appropriate restricted view — corrected to match the telecaller pattern.

## Cross-check audit (verified against all 4 sources: aadyaenterprisesown, smart-timekeeper/Punchly, ksquaremediahub.online, nt)
Re-audited every source repo directly (not from memory) and found + fixed real gaps:

**Confirmed missing, now built:**
- **Gallery, Team, Testimonials had zero admin UI** — the tables existed in the schema since the very first migration, the public site could read testimonials, but there was no way to add/edit/remove a gallery photo, team member, or testimonial without touching Supabase directly. Built **Super Admin → Gallery / Team / Reviews** (add/hide/delete for all three) and wired **Gallery** and **Team** sections into the public homepage (they were never rendered at all before).
- **Photo change approval** — mirrors the bank-detail approval pattern (Punchly has this; we only had it for bank details). Employee uploads a new profile photo from **My Profile**, it's held pending until **Super Admin → Approvals → Profile Photos** approves it.
- **Blood group + ID proof number** — captured at onboarding, blood group shown on the printable ID card for emergency use (Punchly parity).
- **Promotions / compensation history** — every designation or CTC change made via Access Control → Manage Access is now automatically logged with before/after values; visible to the employee under My Profile → Role & Compensation History, and to HR.

**Confirmed NOT missing (verified, not assumed):**
- Documents auto-filter by category, e-signature capture, onboarding wizard, telecaller/executive/manager workflows, career applications, notifications — all checked directly against the code, all present and wired correctly.

**Explicitly flagged as intentionally not built (documented, not silently skipped):**
- **Shift/late-fine automation** — Punchly has configurable grace-period + late-fine-per-minute payroll deduction logic. We added the lighter version (default start time + grace period stored, ready for a "late" flag) but did not build automatic fine deduction — that's a payroll-correctness-critical feature that deserves its own dedicated pass rather than being rushed in.
- **Payslip generation / payment history** — Punchly tracks actual salary *payments* (unpaid/partial/paid) separately from salary *structure*. We have the structure (what's owed) but not payment tracking (what's actually been paid, when). Flagging this as the next most valuable HR addition if wanted.

## Final cross-check: ported directly from Punchly (not reinvented)
Per direct request — pulled the real SQL/logic from smart-timekeeper instead of rebuilding conceptually, adapted only where the schema differs (no tenant_id/branch_id — Nikki is single-company with segment_slug scoping instead):

- **Shifts + late-fine policy** (`shifts`, `staff_shifts`) — define shift timing, grace period, and a late-fine policy (none / fixed per occurrence / per-minute / half-day-after-N-minutes), assign staff to shifts. Check-in now automatically compares the time against the assigned shift and flags `is_late` + `minutes_late` — shown right on the attendance screen ("Late by 12 min").
- **Payslips + salary_payments** (real payment tracking, ported near-verbatim including the payment-status trigger) — distinct from salary *structure* (what's owed): this tracks what was actually **generated and paid**, per month, with partial-payment support. Super Admin → HR → Payslips: generate a payslip (auto-pulls base pay + bonus + incentives from salary structure, you enter attendance/leave/late days), then record payments against it (cash/bank/UPI/cheque) — status auto-flips unpaid → partial → paid as payments come in. Employee sees their own payslip history under My Documents.
- **Attendance Summary RPC** (`staff_attendance_summary`, `daily_attendance_trend`) — ported directly as real Postgres functions (not client-side approximation): present/absent/on-leave days and attendance % per staff member over a selectable window, excluding the super admin account from the count (same as Punchly excludes the tenant owner). Super Admin → HR → Attendance Summary.

All of this required its own migration since it's genuinely new schema (shifts, staff_shifts, payslips, salary_payments, plus is_late/minutes_late/shift_id on attendance_records).

## Real workflow parity check against original Aadya (not just feature presence — actual role logic)
Re-read the original 1000+ line role portals (ManagerPortal, TelecallerPortal, ExecutivePortal, HRPortal, EmployeePortal) directly instead of relying on my earlier summary pass. Found 3 real workflow gaps where a *permission* existed but no UI exposed it, or a genuinely useful view was missing entirely:

1. **Team Activity Feed** — Managers/Super Admin previously had no way to see team-wide call/visit/note activity without opening each lead individually. Added **CRM → Team Activity**: a live, company-wide stream of every call, visit and note across all leads, most recent first, with who-did-it and when.
2. **Field-generated leads** — Marketing Executives already had `create_leads` permission granted by default, but no UI let them use it. A field rep finding a new prospect door-to-door had no way to add them. Added **"+ Add Lead"** directly in the Field Visits tab — goes straight into her own queue.
3. **Overdue callback distinction** — Telecaller queue treated all scheduled callbacks the same. Now overdue callbacks (past their scheduled time) show a red "⚠ Overdue" flag distinct from upcoming ones (amber), matching the urgency-sorting the original Telecaller Portal had.

Also fixed: **HR now has `view_leads`** by default (read-only CRM visibility), matching the original HRPortal's CRM tab — HR often needs to see sales/lead context for hiring and escalation coordination.

One small migration: `20260714000002_hr_crm_visibility_parity.sql`.

## CRITICAL FIX: Admin features were unreachable by anyone except the literal super_admin account
This was the most serious bug found in the full audit. Every admin capability — Access Control (onboarding), Segments, Products, Documents & Onboarding, Approvals, Announcements, Careers, Gallery/Team/Reviews, Website Content, Shifts, Payslips, Attendance Summary — had correct database-level permissions (`manage_staff`, `manage_content`, `manage_payroll`, `manage_careers`, etc.) letting HR/managers use them. **But the app's routing only ever showed the admin console to `role === 'super_admin'`.** An HR account with every permission granted still could not reach a single admin screen — they'd land in the plain staff portal with no way in. The entire permission-override system built throughout this project was effectively dead code for anyone but the owner account.

**Fixed:**
- Routing (`App.tsx`) now grants admin console access to **anyone with an admin-capable permission**, not just `super_admin` — checked against the same permissions the database actually enforces.
- The admin console's sidebar is now **filtered per-tab to match real RLS permissions** (e.g. Segments/Website Content require `manage_content` — mirroring the DB policy exactly; Access Control requires `manage_staff`; Payslips requires `manage_payroll`) so nobody sees a tab that would silently fail on save.
- Self-service tabs (My Attendance, My Documents, Leaves & Advances, My Profile, Shift Swap) are now available **inside the admin console too** — an HR person or manager needs to check in and see their own payslip just like anyone else; they're no longer forced to choose between "admin mode" and "being a staff member."
- Fixed an inconsistency: `document_templates` was gated to `is_super_admin()` only while everywhere else onboarding-related uses `manage_staff` — relaxed to match.
- Sidebar label now reads "Admin Console" for permission-holders and "Super Admin" only for the actual owner account, so it doesn't look mislabeled for HR staff.

**Known follow-up, flagged not fixed:** `manage_staff` currently lets someone edit *any* user's `permission_overrides`, including granting themselves permissions beyond their own level (e.g. an HR person with `manage_staff` could grant themselves `manage_content`). This is a privilege-escalation edge case worth a dedicated pass — restricting which permission keys a non-super-admin can toggle — rather than a rushed fix here.

## Other bugs found in this pass
- Verified every table has RLS enabled (none missing).
- Verified no duplicate `CREATE POLICY` names across migrations that would fail on a second run (the one apparent duplicate already had `DROP POLICY IF EXISTS` before it — safe).

## CRITICAL SECURITY FIX: cross-segment data leak for single-segment managers
Direct audit of every RLS policy on staff-management tables (attendance, leaves, advances, documents, bank/photo approvals, promotions, payslips, shifts, job postings, career applications) found that **none of them checked segment overlap** — only `has_permission()`, which is company-wide. HR (segments=`['all']`) was fine by design, but a **single-segment manager granted `approve_leaves` (a manager default) could see and approve leave requests for every segment**, not just their own — same for attendance, salary advances, documents, bank-detail approvals, and payslips. This directly broke the "each segment manager only manages their own team" design from the original spec.

**Fixed** with a new `can_access_staff(target_id)` helper that checks real segment overlap between the acting user and the target staff member (same `'all'` bypass HR already relies on), applied to all 12 affected tables. Nothing changes for `super_admin` or any `'all'`-segment role — this only tightens single-segment managers to their own team, which was always the intent.

One migration: `20260715000002_segment_scoping_security_fix.sql`.

## End-to-end code sweep (final pass)
Systematic checks run against the actual code, not assumptions:
- **Typecheck + ESLint**: clean. Remaining lint output is all `no-explicit-any` (intentional loose typing on Supabase query results, standard for this kind of app) and a few `exhaustive-deps` warnings on intentional mount-only effects — no real bugs.
- **Every notify_user() trigger call** verified against the function's 5-argument signature — all correct.
- **Every storage bucket referenced in frontend code** (`career-uploads`, `lead-photos`, `selfies`, `site-photos`) verified to exist in migrations — no typos, no missing buckets.
- **Payslip upsert conflict target** verified to match the actual `UNIQUE(staff_user_id, period_year, period_month)` constraint.
- **Disabled-account handling** verified in AuthContext — inactive staff are signed out immediately on both login and session restore.
- **Segment-scoped shift lookup** at check-in verified against RLS (staff can always read their own `staff_shifts` row and any `shifts` definition).

**Real workflow gap found and fixed:** Payslip generation required **100% manual entry** of present/absent/leave/late days even though the exact data already existed in `attendance_records` and `leave_requests`. Added **"Auto-fill from Attendance & Leave Records"** — pulls real check-ins, late flags, and approved leaves for the selected staff member and month, computes days automatically. HR can still review/adjust before generating — this removes manual counting as a source of payroll errors.
